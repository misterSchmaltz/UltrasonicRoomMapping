# UltrasonicRoomMapping
Ultrasonic room mapping utilizing Arduino via bluetooth

This project will contain the Arduino java code and the python GUI that will communicate and utilize the data from the microcontroller.
The board being used is a Arduino Uno microcontroller. The Arduino rangefinder that's connected is the HC-SR04, an HC-06 Bluetooth module is used to communicate over serial bus, and all components are mounted on an RC car.

The Arduino source code is contained within BluetoothScan.io, this is uploaded to the board prior to testing, it is contained in the top most file directory: UltrasonicRoomMappin\untitled\BluetoothScan.io

The python file used is RoomScan.py, the directory path is as follows: UltrasonicRoomMapping\untitled\RoomScan.py

Extended documentation of the project is provided in the document titled: Ramirez_CSC400_Final_Design_Document
